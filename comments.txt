Project 4:
-50 The ratio for ticks-used is not close enough to the ratio of tickets
$ spin 3 100000000 &;spin 9 100000000 &
$tickets: 1 	 pid: 11 	 ticks-used: 1
tickets: 1 	 pid: 10 	 ticks-used: 2
 tickets: 1 	 pid: 11 	 ticks-used: 0
tickets: 1 	 pid: 10 	 ticks-used: 2
tickets: 9 	 pid: 11 	 ticks-used: 1104
tickets: 3 	 pid: 10 	 ticks-used: 345
zombie!
tickets: 3 	 pid: 10 	 ticks-used: 1155
zombie!

ratio should be 1:3, the ratio for ticks-used is either 3.2 or 3.3478
