Project 1:
-3 test for wzip 2 incorrect
[31mtest 2: out incorrect[0m
  what results should be found in file: tests/2.out
  what results produced by your program: tests-out/2.out
  compare the two using diff, cmp, or related tools to debug, e.g.:
  prompt> diff tests/2.out tests-out/2.out


Project 4:
-50 The ratio for ticks-used is not close enough to the ratio of tickets
$ spin 3 100000000 &;spin 9 100000000 &
$tickets: 1 	 pid: 11 	 ticks-used: 1
tickets: 1 	 pid: 10 	 ticks-used: 2
 tickets: 1 	 pid: 11 	 ticks-used: 0
tickets: 1 	 pid: 10 	 ticks-used: 2
tickets: 9 	 pid: 11 	 ticks-used: 1104
tickets: 3 	 pid: 10 	 ticks-used: 345
zombie!
tickets: 3 	 pid: 10 	 ticks-used: 1155
zombie!

ratio should be 1:3, the ratio for ticks-used is either 3.2 or 3.3478

-55 readonlycode2.c
$ readonlycode2 
pid 3 readonlycode2: trap 14 err 5 on cpu 0 eip 0xf addr 0x1000--kill proc

the result should look like this
$ readonlycode2
mprotect call succeeded
munprotect call succeeded
