1: 2 new system calls made for protect and unprotect

2. Created 2 new files called protect.c and unprotect.c

3. In protect if assert fails it will kill the ppid. protect also kill when start = 2 instead of one. In the mean time assert will call mprotect on start.

4. In unprotect we do something similar but run it with multiple iterations

Null1 and readonlycode2 I do not believe work properly.
